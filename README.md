# gamified-cybersecurity-lms
A gamified Learning Management System designed to make cybersecurity awareness engaging, interactive, and effective.

This project is a gamified cybersecurity awareness LMS designed for a university audience. It delivers short, interactive training modules (passwords, MFA, phishing, deepfakes) using game-like activities rather than passive video-only training.

Current Status
- Gamified modules completed in H5P/Lumi and exportable as SCORM packages
- LMS MVP planning in-progress
- Initial hosting plan: self-host on homelab
